# ml-boilerplate

My personal ML boilerplate with colorful logging and customizable configurations.

## Ingredients

This boilerplate **includes...**

- [**logging**](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html): Python's native logger - miles better than `print()`.
- [**rich**](https://github.com/willmcgugan/rich): An easy choice to make console outputs colorful and pretty.
- [**OmegaConf**](https://github.com/omry/omegaconf): A great alternative to `argparse` that supports YAML config files.

This boilerplate **does not include...**

- [**PyTorch Lightning**](https://github.com/PyTorchLightning/pytorch-lightning): Great initiative, but difficult to use due to inconsistent documentation.
- [**Hydra**](https://hydra.cc/): Does too much that I didn't ask for. OmegaConf is what I wanted.
